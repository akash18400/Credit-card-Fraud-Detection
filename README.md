# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using machine learning algorithms. The aim is to identify anomalies and build a predictive model that can detect fraud effectively—even in highly imbalanced datasets.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset

Records: 284,807 transactions

Features: 30 anonymized columns + Class (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)

📌 Key Concepts Used
Anomaly Detection: Identifying rare fraudulent patterns in highly imbalanced data.

Feature Engineering: Standardized Amount and Time features.

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression (baseline).

Real-time Monitoring (Future Scope): Capable of integration with streaming data for live fraud detection.

Scalability: Modular design for handling large-scale financial data.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

Evaluation Metrics:

Precision & Recall

ROC-AUC Score

Confusion Matrix

✅ Real-time Use Cases
Banking Systems: Real-time flagging of suspicious credit card usage.

E-commerce: Alerting users and admins when a potentially fraudulent transaction is made.

Insurance: Detecting false claims using similar anomaly detection strategies.

Fintech Apps: Plug-and-play integration with live transaction monitoring dashboards.

📝 Future Improvements
Use advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

Integrate SMOTE for handling data imbalance

Real-time alerts via Kafka or socket-based APIs

Streamlit or Flask dashboard for live visualization
